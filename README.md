Sadak Sathi is a comprehensive civic engagement platform designed to bridge the communication gap between citizens and local government authorities for infrastructure-related issues. Built on the open-source FixMyStreet framework, this web-based application enables citizens to report, track, and monitor the resolution of local infrastructure problems such as potholes, broken streetlights, damaged roads, and other public facility issues.
The platform employs a modern technology stack comprising Perl with the Catalyst web framework for robust backend processing, PostgreSQL for reliable data management, and responsive HTML5/CSS3/JavaScript for an intuitive user interface. The system implements a multi-tenant architecture through cobranding, allowing different cities and municipalities to maintain their own branded instances while sharing the core platform infrastructure.
