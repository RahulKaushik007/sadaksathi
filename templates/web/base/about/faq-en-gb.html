<dl>

    <dt>What is this site?</dt>
    <dd>[% site_name %] is a site to help people report to their
    local authority, view, or discuss local issues they&rsquo;ve found, by
    simply locating them on a map.</dd>

    <dt>How do I get in touch with [% site_name %]?</dt>
    <dd>Here&rsquo;s our <a href="/contact">contact page</a>.</dd>

    <dt>What sort of problems should I report with [% site_name %]?</dt>
    <dd>This depends upon the precise purpose of [% site_name %];
    such as:
    <ul>
    <li>Abandoned vehicles
    <li>Dog Fouling
    <li>Flyposting or graffiti
    <li>Flytipping or litter
    <li>Streetcleaning, such as broken glass in a cycle lane
    <li>Unlit lampposts
    <li>Potholes
    </ul>
    </dd>

    <dt>What isn&rsquo;t [% site_name %] for?</dt>
    <dd>[% site_name %] is not a way of getting in touch with your
    authority for all issues &ndash; please use this site only for problems
    such as the above. We often route problem reports via cleansing services or
    highways and so using this site for other matters may result in a delay in
    your report getting to the right department. <strong>You will need to
    contact your authority directly for problems such as</strong>:

    <ul><li>Anti-social behaviour
    <li>Any urgent or emergency problems
    <li>Noise pollution or barking dogs
    <li>Fires and smoke/smell pollution
    <li>Missing wheelie bins or recycling boxes or missed rubbish collections
    <li>Proposals for speed bumps/ CCTV/ pedestrian crossings/ new road layouts/ etc.
    <li>Complaining about your neighbours
    <li>Complaining about the authority
    <li>Joy riding, drug taking, animal cruelty, or other criminal activity
    </ul>
    <p>Authorities often have direct hotlines for these sorts of issues.</p>
    </dd>

    <dt>How do I use the site?</dt>
    <dd>After entering a location, you are presented with a map of that area.
    You can view problems already reported in that area, or report ones of your
    own by clicking on the map at the location of the problem.</dd>

    <dt>How are the problems solved?</dt>
    <dd>They are reported to the relevant authority by email. The authority can
    then resolve the problem the way they normally would. Alternatively, you
    can discuss the problem on the website with others, and then together lobby
    the authority to fix it, or fix it directly yourselves.</dd>

    <dt>Is it free?</dt>
    <dd>Yes.</dd>

    <dt>Can I use [% site_name %] on my mobile?</dt>
    <dd>
    <p>The [% site_name %] website will already work on your mobile
    phone, adapting to the size of your screen automatically.</p>

<h2><a name="practical"></a>Practical Questions</h2>

<dl>
    <dt>I&rsquo;m from an authority, where do you send the reports?</dt>
    <dd>You can either leave a test report or <a href="/contact">contact us</a>
to find out where reports go at the moment. Also <a href="/contact">contact us</a>
to update the address or addresses we use.</dd>

    <dt>I&rsquo;m from an authority, can we have [% site_name %]
    on our website?</dt>
    <dd>Quite possibly &ndash; contact the people who run this site.</dd>

    <dt>Do you remove silly or illegal content?</dt>
    <dd>[% site_name %] is not responsible for the content and
    accuracy of material submitted by its users. We reserve the right to
    edit or remove any problems or updates which we consider to be
    inappropriate upon being informed by a user of the site.</dd>

    <dt>Why can&rsquo;t I zoom out more on the reporting map?</dt>
    <dd>We want to keep [% site_name %] locally focused, so restrict
    the ability to move radically between areas. The map on Your Reports will
    let you see all the reports you&rsquo;ve made, wherever they are. If
    you&rsquo;re from the authority then the emailed version of the problem
    report might also contain the closest road or postcode to the pin on the
    map.</dd>
